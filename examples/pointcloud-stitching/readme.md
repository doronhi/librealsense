# Software Device Sample

## Overview

This sample demonstrates stitching 2 pointclouds from 2 separate devices together. 


`pointcloud-stitching` requires pre-calculated calibration between 2 fixed RealSense depth cameras. It stitches the 2 pointclouds together and presents live depth and color images produced by projecting the united pointcloud back onto an inner, predefined software device.
